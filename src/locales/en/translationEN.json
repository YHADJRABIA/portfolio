    "title": "About me",
    "content": "Following my graduation as an Electrical Engineer and after a first work experience mixing electronics and web development, I decided to retrain as a Full Stack Web Developer through a 3-month coding bootcamp given better job opportunities in that field. Most of my spare time is spent honing my skills, acquiring new ones, or making the subtitles of a Russian series.\n Here I am now, looking for opportunities as a Web Developer. For your reference — my Russian and Swedish are self-taught."

  "skills": {
    "title": "Skills",
    "content": "Initially trained as an Electrical Engineer, coding has been an ubiquitous part of a curriculum within which the use of MATLAB, VHDL and other Electrical-Engineering-oriented tools were common practice to the chip-coding and microcontroller-handling student I used to be. Given the nature of the position I wish to hold — skills that are irrelevant to Web Development won't be showcased below. Bear in mind that – as a keen learner – I may list more skills soon enough!"
